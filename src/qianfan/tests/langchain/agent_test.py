    Title: Is Physics Sick? [In Praise of Classical Physics]
    Authors: Hisham Ghassib
    Summary: In this paper, it is argued that theoretical physics is more akin to an
    organism than to a rigid structure.It is in this sense that the epithet,
    "sick", applies to it. It is argued that classical physics is a model of a
    healthy science, and the degree of sickness of modern physics is measured
    accordingly. The malady is located in the relationship between mathematics and
    physical meaning in physical theory.
